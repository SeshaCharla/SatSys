Title: Modelling and Parameter Estimation of Diesel Engine After-treatment System under Catalyst Saturation for Aging
Diagnostics

Overall Narrative:
-----------------
1. The NO_x reduction dynamics are different when the Catalyst is saturted as it is independent of the urea-dosing.
2. The I/O dynamics for NO_x reduction under Catalyst Saturation forms an upper bound to the actual NO_x reduction dynamics which switch between Saturation and de-saturation.
3. This relationhip is used for estimating the model parameters through a constrained optimization problem.
4. The model parameter are a strong function of mean and variance of temperature of the data set owing to the approximation used in temperature modelling.
5. The approach is validated by showing the similarity between the paramter estimates across different data sets of the same catalyst under the sufficient statistics.
6. We introduce the NO_x sensor cross sensitivity into the estimation problem, modify the convex optimization with regularization paramter that captures the effect of cross-sensitivity.
7. The approach is validated by comparing the results of FTIR data and NO_x sensor data and NO_x sensor data across all the available data sets.
8. There are two main applications for this model,
        a. Identifying the segments of the data where the catalyst is confirmed to be desaturated.
        b. The paramteres capture the aging levels of the catalyst
9. The segment identification is demonstrated using the +/-20% gain data and validated by showing the reduction in the legnth of de-saturated data due to increase in the feedback gain.
10. The capturing of aging-effects is demonstrated by comparing the aged and degreened test-cell data and demonstrated using the truck data as well.
