This work develops a reduced-order nonlinear discrete model from first principles to describe the dynamics of a diesel
engine's SCR catalyst under ammonia saturation. A novel parameter estimation algorithm is proposed utilizing the
relationship between predicted and measured $NO_x$ reduction in the system while explicitly considering the
uncertainties due to $NO_x$ sensor cross-sensitivity. The model forms part of a discrete nonlinear switched framework
that captures catalyst reaction dynamics, switching between saturation and desaturation modes depending on urea dosing.
By explicitly accounting for the interplay between residence time and sampling, the model parameters provide insights
into quantifying catalyst's aging.
