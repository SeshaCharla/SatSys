The present work developes a dynamic model for $NO_x$ reduction in diesel engine SCR systems when the catalyst is
saturated with ammonia while explicitly considering the interplay between the residence time and the sampling frequency
of the sensors. A novel parameter estimation algorithm is proposed utilizing the relationship between actual $NO_x$
reduction and predicted $NO_x$ reduction under saturation in the system while explicitly considering effects of the
uncertainties due to $NO_x$ sensor cross-sensitivity. Further, the model parameters are shown to be sensitive to the
catalyst's aging state. Using the paramter estimates and their statistics, a hypothesis-testing framework based on the
Wald test is developed to detect catalyst aging. The performance of the proposed aging detector is demonstrated using
both test-cell data at different aging levels and real-world data from four long-haul trucks.
