This work develops a reduced-order nonlinear discrete model from first principles to describe the dynamics of a diesel
engine's SCR catalyst under ammonia saturation for detecting aging. The model explicitly accounts for the interplay
between the residence time of the reacting flow and the sampling of the sensors. A novel parameter estimation algorithm
is proposed utilizing the relationship between predicted and measured $NO_x$ reduction in the system while explicitly
considering the uncertainties due to $NO_x$ sensor cross-sensitivity. The model parameters are shown to be sensitive to
the catalyst's aging state. A statistical test based on the Wald test statistic is developed to detect catalyst aging
using the estimated parameters of the saturated catalyst model. The performance of the proposed aging detector is
demonstrated using both test-cell and real-world truck data.
