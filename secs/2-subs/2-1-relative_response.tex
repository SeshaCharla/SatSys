%% 2. The I/O dynamics for NO_x reduction under Catalyst Saturation forms an upper bound to the actual NO_x reduction dynamics which switch between Saturation and de-saturation.
%===
It can be observed that, in a given time step maximum $NO_x$ reduction happens when the catalyst is saturated. Thus,
under the same temperature, flow rate and inlet $NO_x$ concentration, the response of the saturated model
(\ref{eqn::eta}) forms a tight upper bound to the response of the actual system, that switched between saturation and
desaturation based on urea dosing.
%===
\begin{align}
        \eta_{sat}(k) \geq \eta(k) \qquad \forall k
        \label{eqn::eta_bound}
\end{align}
%===
This relationship can is used for model parameter estimation.
