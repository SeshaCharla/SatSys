%% 2. The I/O dynamics for NO_x reduction under Catalyst Saturation forms an upper bound to the actual NO_x reduction dynamics which switch between Saturation and de-saturation.
%===
It can be observed that, in a given time step maximum $NO_x$ reduction happens when the catalyst is saturated. Thus,
under the same temperature, flow rate and inlet $NO_x$ concentration, the response of the saturated model
(\ref{eqn::nox_mdl}) forms a tight upper bound to the response of the actual system, that switches between saturation
and desaturation based on urea dosing, flow rate and catalyst temperature. This results in the following bounding
condition (\ref{eqn::eta_bound}) on response of the saturated system's response.
%===
\begin{align}
        \eta_F^{sat}(k) \geq \eta_F(k) \qquad \forall k
        \label{eqn::eta_bound}
\end{align}
%===
This relationship can is used for model parameter estimation.
