\subsection{$NO_x$ sensor cross-sensitivity}
The commercial $NO_x$ sensors are cross-sensitive to the ammonia in the tailpipe. The cross-sensitivity error is modeled as a function of tailpipe ammonia and a cross-sensitivity factor, $\chi(T)$.
This introduces a directional error $\lr{\varepsilon_\chi= \chi\lr{T(k)} \times \con{NH_3}^{out}>0}$ into the tailpipe $NO_x$ measurement $y_1$. Thus, when the $NO_x$ reduction in a time-step is calculated using the $NO_x$ sensor measurements, $y_1(k) = x_1(k) + \varepsilon_{\chi}(k)$, we get a quantity that is less than the actual $NO_x$ reduction.
\begin{align}
        \eta_y(k) &= u_1(k-1) - y_1(k) =  \eta(k) - \varepsilon_\chi(k) \leq \eta{k} \label{eqn::cross_meas}
\end{align}
Thus, the bounding condition on the saturated system's response (\ref{eqn::eta_bound}) holds even when the $NO_x$ reduction during the time-step is calculated using the $NO_x$ sensor measurements.
\begin{align}
        \eta_{sat}(k) &\geq \eta(k) = \eta_y(k)+\varepsilon_\chi(k) \geq \eta_y(k) \label{eqn::eta_y_bound}
\end{align}
