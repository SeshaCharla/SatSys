\subsection{Test-cell data results using FTIR Measurements (no cross-sensitivity)}
The parameter estiamtes for different catalysts of same capacity under similar experimental conditions (RMC, hot and cold FTP) are identical demonstrating the validity of the modelling and paramter estimation approach. The predicted $NO_x$ reduction under catalyst saturation is equvalent considering the uncertainity.
