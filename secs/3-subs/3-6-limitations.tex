\par Furthermore, the above delineated parameter estimation method has a limitation that the dataset must have response
of the catalyst under saturation for finite duration. If this condition is not met, the algorithm estimates the
parameters considering the maximum concentration of adsorbed ammonia as the concentration corresponding to catalyst
saturation (Appendix-\ref{sec::necessary_cond}).
