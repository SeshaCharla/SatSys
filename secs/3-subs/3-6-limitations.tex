% \subsection{Limitations of the Parameter Estiamtion Method}
A limitation of the delineated parameter estimation method is that the data-set must have response of the catalyst under
saturation for finite duration. If this condition is not met, the algorithm estimates the paramters considering the
maximum concentration of adsorbed ammonia as the concentration corresponding to catalyst saturation (Appendix-\ref{sec::necessary_cond}).
