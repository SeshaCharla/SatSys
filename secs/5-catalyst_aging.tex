\section{Model Paramters Capture Catalyst Aging}
The paramters of the saturated system a function of the rate-constant for SCR reaction and the maximum surface
concentration of vaible voids on the catalyst. The adsorption cite concentration is hypothesized to change with aging of
the catalyst allowing the parameters to capture the aging of the catalyst. This is demonstrated using the test-cell
experiments on a new (de-greened) and hydro-thermally aged catalyst with the same capacity. The predicted $NO_x$
reduction for an aged catalyst is found to be statistically lower than the predicted $NO_x$ reduction in a de-greened
catalyst.
