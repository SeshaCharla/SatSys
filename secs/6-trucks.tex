\section{Aging Detection from Truck Data}

The performance of the proposed aging detector is also demonstrated using the $NO_x$ sensor data from four long-haul
truck. The road data was collected from trucks operating in the United States  for two days separated by a few years
during which the catalyst has aged based on the existing performance measures. The data contains measurements of $NO_x$
sensors before and after the catalyst, as well as other required variables including flow rate, temperature and urea
injection rate. The data preporcessing includes,
\begin{inparaenum}
        \item removing the rows with missing values,
        \item removing the rows whose operating temperature range is beyond range of $200-300 \,^0C$,
        \item interpolating the missing data if the data breaks are smaller than a minute, and finally,
        \item smooting the data using non-causal chebyshev filter.
\end{inparaenum}
The preprocessed data is than partitioned into drive segments with no breaks which correspond to a continuous driving
period from engine start to engine stop.
